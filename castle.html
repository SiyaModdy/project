            <h2>Brief History</h2>
            <p>The Castle is located in the City of Cape Town, South Africa. The Castle is one of the oldest
                existing buildings in South Africa. It was built between 1666- 1679 by the Dutch East India Company
                (DEIC).

                The building served as military headquarters, meeting place for both cititzen and soldiers, time
                announcement alarm and warn of possible threats.

                Later, during the Second Boer war the castle was used to imprison Africans that opposed the land
                disposession
                imposed by the Dutch settlers(DEIC)- many of those leaders were "Pan African" leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today the castle serves as place of education and monument that reminds all of its visitors of South
                Africa's history.
